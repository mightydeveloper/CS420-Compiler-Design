AR template explanation

My design uses 6 area: FP, SP, RP, VR, MEM, GLOBAL.

RP stores function return value and GLOBAL contains global scope variables.
All other area is given in project description.

FP, SP, RP is treated as speical register, so only address 0 of each area used.

AR is stored in MEM, and looks like below.

address	n		|	n+1		n+2		n+3		n+4  ...	|
value	old FP	|	local variables in declared order	|  ...

address	n+m		|	n+m+1	n+m+2	n+m+3	...		|				|
value	locals	|	parameters in declared order	|  return addr 	| old FP	| ...

All allocation is in declaration order.

AR is stacked with sequence of (old FP, local variables, parameters, return address)

My AR allocates all local variables declared in function body in advance even program doesn't use.

Main function's old FP is zero. This fact used on return phase so that program will be terminated.
